- Wire Generators up (the remaining ones)
- Wire Filters up (the remaining ones)

- Networks can't be wired up, ask Jeff to help get the networks setup in the .py file he sent previously.
- Make panel on the right collapsible? (for stylings in smaller screens...?)
- Fill out UploadImage component in ./Generators/ (pass in the already existing button and logic)
- add sass to make css scalable and reusable.


## TODO (Lower priority):

- Change GUI to make it look like mock gui design. (in progress).

## Instructions:

When you pull the code from the repo, first run `npm install` in the terminal at the root directory to load all in the required npm modules. Once that command has finished, run `npm start` in the terminal at the root directory to run the front-end locally on your machine. You can view the front-end at `http://localhost:3000/`.
