## TODO From Meetings (Updated Feb 16, 2021):

- Wire Filters up (the remaining ones)
- Wire Metrics up (ex: Pore Size Distribution).
- Networks can't be wired up, ask Jeff to help get the networks setup in the .py file he sent previously.
- Load Image button -> translate it to the GridList component (panel of images).
- Have a panel on the right displaying images (Material UI Cards).
- Make panel on the right collapsible? (for stylings in smaller screens)
- Fill out UploadImage component in ./Generators/ (pass in the already existing button and logic)
- add sass to make css scalable and reusable.


## TODO:

- Change GUI to make it look like mock gui design. (in progress).
- Get a Favicon.ico.
