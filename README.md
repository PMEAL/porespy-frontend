## TODO From Meetings (Updated Feb 16, 2021):

- Load Image button -> translate it to the GridList component (panel of images).
- Continue mapping out remaining generators/filters/metrics.
- Have a panel on the right displaying images (Material UI Cards).
- Make panel on the right collapsable, style it correctly.
- Right panel should have a download button for each generated image, and a "Use Image" button as well.
- Fill out UploadImage component in ./Generators/ (pass in the already existing button and logic)
- In the each filters component, have a dropdown to choose which images to apply the filters on.
- For the Thin NonPercolating Paths filter, 2 images must be passed (have 2 dropdowns?)


## TODO:

- Change GUI to make it look like mock gui design. (in progress).
- Get a Favicon.ico.
- CSS Stylings for About Page, LandingPage components.
